        <h2>Additional Experiences</h2>
        <h3>Student Missionary Work</h3>
        <p>I have been on five mission trips with my churchâ€™s youth group: three to
            Montego Bay, Jamaica, one to Mexicali, Mexico, and one to Detroit, Michigan. In the mission field, we work with school children, residents of a disabled
            home, orphans, and impoverished families. I am greatful for these experiences as they have allowed me to gain perspective on different cultures and economies, and allowed me to give my time to people in need.</p>
        <h3>Extra-Cirriculars</h3>
        <p>At Michigan State, I participated in extra cirriculars such as volunteering on the Audio Production team at the Impact89FM campus radio station, and playing lead guitar in a worship band with Riverview Church.</p>
