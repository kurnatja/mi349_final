            <h3>SpringHill Camps - Event Production Technician</h3>
            <h4>May-August 2018</h4>
            <p>SpringHill camps serve hundreds of youth campers from ages 6 to 19,
                providing music, visual and live production events daily. I worked on the
                production team as the campâ€™s only sound technician. I was able to interact
                with musicians and administrators to coordinate stage tech and setup, and
                production for live events. Additionally, I ran lights, projections, and used Qlab for production cues.</p>
