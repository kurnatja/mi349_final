            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Jacob Kurnat, I am 21 years old, and I am currently a fourth year student at Michigan State University studying Media and Information, set to graduate in May of 2021. I am originally from South Lyon, Michigan. My degree program at Michigan State has allowed me to gain experience in many different areas within the broad world of Media and Information, and my work expereince has proven to be a great suppliment to the things I have learned in my classes. Additionally, my interest in the world of media technology has led me to form hobbies such as sound engineering, and music production, which I often study on my own time. Upon graduation in 2021, I aim to use my education, experience, and love for media technology in a relevant career in the Media and Information field.</p>

            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p>Ultimately, my main career goal is to be a sound engineer. Whether I work with live events/productions, or post production roles such as sound design or mix engineering, I hope to be able to work in the sound engineering field in some capacity. I have work expereince in the production of live events, as well as in the Audio/Visual field that has allowed me to constantly stay in practice of my technical skills while learning tons of new things along the way. I hope to use my variety of experience from work as well as my classes to help me not only get started on my carreer post graduation, but to excel in whatever position I end up in.</p>
